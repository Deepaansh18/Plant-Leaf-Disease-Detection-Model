**Plant Disease Recognition System**

**1.Overview of the project**
This project uses photos of leaves to identify plant diseases using a deep learning-based system. The system recognizes different plant diseases and 
makes fast predictions using refined transfer learning models.Farmers and researchers can easily utilize the solution 
thanks to its straightforward web interface.

**2.Features**
•  Divides photos of plant leaves into several disease categories.
•  Explains the causes of diseases and offers recommendations for treatments.
•  Immediate predictions and an easy-to-use web interface for uploading images.
•  Use an effective model architecture to achieve high accuracy (up to 96%).
•  Deployable both locally and through cloud environments such as Google Colab.

**3.Technologies/Tools Used**
•  Python 3.12
•  TensorFlow and Keras 
•  Google Colab 
•  Data manipulation with NumPy
•  Front-end HTML/CSS
•  Pre trained:MobileNetV2 and EfficientNet

**4.Steps to Install & Run the Project**
a.**Download the model**.
    To access the Google Drive link, click [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Ond7UzrNOfdAXWedjlZr2sDXYU6MRBuj/view?usp=sharing).

c.**Put the model inside the folder.** 
    Transfer the downloaded file to the directory called "models."
     
d. **Verify the Setup** 
    List the contents of the folder to confirm that the model file is properly located in the `models` directory:
    You should see the downloaded model file in the output.

**5.Instructions for testing**
•   Open the web interface.

•   Click "Choose File" to upload a sample leaf image.

•   Click "Upload" to get the prediction.

•   The interface will display the predicted disease, its cause, and recommended cure.

•   Test using various images from the Plant Village dataset .
